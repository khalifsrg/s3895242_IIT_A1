					<h3>What is your interest in IT?</h3>
					<p>My Interest in Information Technology is to be able to fully understand the systems that are hidden within the computers that we own. I find that interesting, and as someone who has little to no experience with computers I am completely new to the world of information technology and it is something that I am willing to study further to eventually uncover new discoveries for myself. Another reason I decided to pursue a career in the field of IT are the vast array of opportunities that are available through the obtained skills learnt in IT. I honestly do not have a specific plan in regard to my future in IT, I am just figuring out which area I enjoy and excel at the most, and will hopefully strengthen my skills in that particular area in IT.</p>

					<h3>When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h3>
					<p>When I was in year 11 of high school, the idea of deciding where you wanted to go after graduating was prompted to us and as someone who was mainly stressed on how I would get to my friends house after school, I did not have a clue what I wanted to do. I came up with many different ideas including; architecture, filmmaking and even electrician. I do not completely remember how the idea came about, but I remember I overheard someone saying how computer security is a field that is increasing in demand and is a sustainable career path, this would be one of the many factors for my decision to pursue a career in IT. Another reason that sparked my interest in IT was my father who has been working in software architecture for 25+ years. Hearing about all the opportunities and experiences that my father had during his many years of work, it was another factor that inspired me.</p>

					<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
					<p>I chose to come to RMIT after seeing my aunty and my older sister attend the uni. They would bring me onto campus at times and it allowed me to see what the facilities that RMIT provided looked like. It was especially before the coronavirus pandemic, when my sister brought me to the campus to study for my VCE that I was adamant on my decision to put RMIT at the top of my uni preferences in VTAC. Another reason I decided to come to RMIT was the community that surrounded the university, I liked the diversity of the students that attended the campus, not only through nationality and culture, but through their expression of their interests through their style and clubs that are available throughout the uni.

					<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
					<p>I expect to learn how to manipulate the systems and programs to be able to facilitate services and programs for users. I believe that many aspects of information technology can be improved and used to assist in many different industries. Nearly every industry, even those that are not IT related, require some sort of IT in order to run their business or company.
