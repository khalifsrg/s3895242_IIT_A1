				<h2>Project Idea</h2>
			</header>

			<section>
				<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>The project that has been chosen is based on the increasing demand for archived fashion from luxury designers. Archive fashion is essentially past collections that have been discontinued from production and it has been a passion for many around the world to collect many different articles of clothing from a variety of designers that show off their work, whether from their consumer-based collections to their runway exclusive clothing. As the culture of archive fashion is based on items that are relatively hard-to-find, the app would facilitate purchasing pieces of clothing that are rare through community and developer assistance. The main goal of the app is to provide a database of the clothes along with the history and the places where it is available to purchase.</p>
				<h3>Motivation</h3>
					<p>The motivation for the idea presented is due to the increasing demand in the fashion market as a whole. The world of fashion and personal style is one that is practiced throughout the world, whether luxurious or fast fashion. The global retail market generates around $1.34 trillion in sales per year without the inclusion of footwear and jewellery, which are huge areas in fashion individually, which when included, the value of the market increases to around 1 trillion (1).  However, the market is not stopping there, it is expected that in 2021 the value will increase by 8% (1). To put it into perspective, an average US consumer purchases one mid-priced item of clothing per week, this plays into part of the idea that the app will based on, the fact that an individual’s clothing rotates so often that they look for a change and much higher quality clothing in order to increase longevity of the clothes they wear on a day-to-day basis. (2)</p>
				<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>The app will consist of many components that would assist the user and overall deliver an enjoyable experience for them. The app will include a camera identifier, a revolutionary new feature that has not been seen in any other website or app that offers similar services. Through the lens of the smartphone or a regular screenshot, the user is able to use their smartphone to quickly identify a piece of clothing that they find interesting and want to know more about. It will be a handy tool for fashion enthusiasts to be able to find pieces they are intrigued about in pictures on social media or in public. The app will use its expansive database in order to assist the user. A section of the app will be reserved for the users to build a community to be able to connect to like-minded people through the app. It will essentially act as a fashion-centric social media. This area will allow users to also express their personal identity through their clothing, while also inspiring other users with their choices of colour combinations and fitting of their chosen pieces of clothing. It is essentially a way for users to share their “art” to others and be appreciated for their creativeness. The database search engine that serves as an efficient method of specifying a users queries throughout out the service. The search engine serves as an integral part of the app as it is one of the most commonly used tools on a program due to it being able to assist the user heavily through easing their searches for products. Mother feature which would differ the app to others available on the internet, is the showcasing aspect, where creators and designers of unique clothing may show their creations and have access to a platform to be able to sell the clothes they make. The links for the websites and listings of the clothes that users intend on purchasing will also be available on the product page, if not available it will simply say out of stock until a listing appears on the web, which will be located by developers or users of the app.  The basics of a clothing database program will be included, such as: brand specific searches, type of garment or accessory specific searches and other components such as a customer assistance service and suggestion section. </p>
					<p>The overall look of the app will be minimalistic to allow for recognition and usability. The intention of the app is for easy learning of the mechanics of the program in order for the user to focus less on how to answer their queries and more on the actual outcome efficiently. It will have a theme that will mimic a virtual vault in order to give a sense of luxuriousness and exclusivity for the user. The app is intended to not look like a tacky website turned app but instead one that looks like it contains the worlds most precious gems.
					</p>
				<h3>Tools And Technologies</h3>
					<p>Using a software such as MIT app developer or App Machine I will essentially create a website first and convert it to an app format as it will allow for use on smartphone as well as computer. It is much more useful as a program and website if it were a website too as it is very often that a user prefers to use their personal computer with the use of browsing through clothing. It will heavily increase traffic for the app and website. There will be elements of augmented reality (AR) for the camera identifying feature that will be primarily based on the app, however screenshots will still be valid for the website. The AR will be developed through Vuforia as it is a commonly used development software used for AR on mobile devices. </p>
				<h3>Skills Required</h3>
					<p>In order to successfully complete the idea that is presented, an individual must learn to master the software described above. The app will not be the result of an amateur programmer or developer as it is something that is not simple in the slightest. The individual must have already created many past project app and websites to have already obtained the skills to complete the application. This can be obtained through the completion of a degree in web development, graphic or communication design along with experience in the field of user centred designed. This can be done through working in companies and obtaining training through the companies assistance and needs.</p>
				<h3>Outcome</h3>
					<p>If the application is successful, the outcome would be a useful tool for archive fashion enthusiasts around the world. It will greatly impact the world of designer clothing as it will remove the troubles of website hopping to search for a piece of clothing that a user may find attractive. It also will allow for creators from all over the world to connect and share their experiences with designing and wearing clothing in order to help interested users. The different feature of the app differ to other fashion apps that are available to the public as it further facilitates access to garments that were originally extremely hard to obtain.</p>
