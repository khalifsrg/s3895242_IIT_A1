				<h3>Cyberscurity Lead Advisor</h3>
					<p>A cybersecurity advisor is in charge of acting as the key communicator between security teams and business units. They are the individuals that establish, build and maintain the working relationships with the internal and external stakeholders of the company, in this context it would be AGL. They are in charge of supervising and maintaining situation awareness of cyber security issues and to keep business leaders informed on the status of the problems and updates.</p>
					<p>They maintain stability in the company through educating security communities of interest to raise awareness on different cyber security and IA issues as required. Along with this, they are also the first to reach for credible information and positive security advice. An advisor understands security technology, solutions, processes and procedures and is able to translate technical concepts into business concepts. In essence, a cybersecurity lead advisor manages the team of system architects, designers and business unit facing engineers. </p>
		
				<h3>Why is this position is appealing to me?</h3>
					<p>This position of work is appealing to me as it is my goal to work become a lead advisor in the field of cyber security. I have always been fascinated by the methods in which IT systems are protected. Along with that, I also intend on working my self up to a high position such as an advisor as it is something I desire. I enjoy working hard, and it would genuinely be satisfying for me to be able to finish off my tasks one by one. On top of the previous points, I also intend to earn a higher wage than a regular employee.</p>

				<h3>What are the skills, qualifications and experience for the job?</h3>
					<p>To be accepted into the role the individual must have already been certified in information security and/or have experience with information security as part of an ICT role. They must also possess expert knowledge and experience in IT security and/or ICT policy, particularly computer security, network security and computer network defence. Knowledge of frameworks, processes and methodologies that contribute to excellent client engagement is required, while also maintaining highly developed communication and relationship management skills when interacting with clients and business leaders. </p>
			
				<h3>What skills, qualifications and experience do you currently have?</h3>
					<p>I currently have no relevant experience in regards to the job position shown above. However in regards to IT in general, I currently do not have any experience in any areas in the field of information technology. In high school I also did not do the VCE subject for IT as it was not made available in the school I was attending. However I intend to work extremely hard to catch up to those who have experience with the programs and software that we are learning to use, in order to catch up to the people who have experience.</p>
				
				<h3>Brief plan on how I will acquire the experience needed for the job I hope to have:</h3>
					<p>In order to build myself up to obtain the experience in order to achieve the goals that I have set for myself, I have planned on finishing this course and hopefully securing a internship in the third year of the course. I will proceed this by attempting to secure a position at a IT company in order to gain experience. If it is required I will after a few years return to study for a masters degree in cyber security in order to further my knowledge, resulting in a more expansive pool of options in regards to job opportunities.</p>
