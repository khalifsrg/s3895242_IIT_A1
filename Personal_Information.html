				<h2>Introduction</h2>

					<h3>Cultural Background</h3>
					<p>My parents were born and raised in Indonesia and moved to Melbourne, Australia 4 years before I was born, which was the year of 2002. I was raised in Melbourne for all my life, however my parents continued to teach me Indonesian culture and language, allowing me to be able to speak fluent my parents mother tongue. I am extremely grateful to my parents to have taught me to speak a language other than English as it has allowed for me to create relationships with people that I would not have been able to meet without being able to speak it, I also hope to continue to learn to read write in many other languages in order to socialise with more people in the multicultural society that is Melbourne and beyond.

					<h3>Education</h3>
					<p>I completed my senior year in high school at Australian International Academy (AIA) in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic and it was one of the most stressful years of my life. I am a person who is naturally extroverted and likes the company of others, especially when it comes to finding the motivation to study. I struggled in 2020 and was devastated after finding out my results did not completely reflect my true potential as a student. This has become the essence of my motivation to perform extremely well in my my time at RMIT. My highest qualification is a Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE).</br>
					Younger primary school students in after school coding programs through Invent the World.</br>
					University level education ranging from 1st year to Post Grad students through RMIT on campus and online via Open University Australia</p>

					<h3>Interests</h3>
					<p>I am a passionate skateboarder and have been continuously skateboarding for almost 10 years. I was honestly one of my biggest challenges in my senior year of high school to have to neglect my desired to go skateboard and focus on my studies, although it has allowed me to train myself to be able to organise my time and provide adequate time for both my studies along with my hobbies. Another interest I have is fashion, I like to research archived clothing have different concept and designs that display an art that is wearable. I admire fashion designers as it is a hard industry to be original and creating something that is different to other people.</p>
