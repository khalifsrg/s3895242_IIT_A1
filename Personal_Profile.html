					<h3>What does this say about me?</h3>
						<p>The first test describes my personality through a series of questions that analyse the different aspects that form someones mind through different scenarios that are presented to the quiz-taker. Although the three tests do not literally dive into someones mind and completely ignore the unbiased choices made by the individual made by the quiz, they outline and present a vague image of the personality of an individual. In my case however it does describe my personality pretty well as I am someone who relies on social interaction in order to distract myself from things that stress me out in my life, which described from my choices in the first test is somewhat often as I am described to be 64% turbulent. As an overall extroverted person it seems right that I am give the role of an analyst and overall a debater as it is very often that I find myself in situations that has me discussing with other people my opinions on certain topics and comparing different thoughts people have on certain subjects.</p>
						<p>In the second test, it analysed my style of learning through a serious of scenarios. This particular test delineates my style of understanding new concepts extremely well. The description states that I am very much not someone who mainly relies on auditory and visual learning but rather I am more of a hands-on learner. This is evident in my recent learning of the new concepts and programs that I have picked up in my first few weeks at university. In this very assignment, I had not fully comprehended how to use a html editor through the examples that I had been shown and read, but rather when I was forced to figure out how to display my work in the form of a web page practically, I was able to efficiently utilise the tools at hand to present my ideas that I wanted to show.</p>
						<p>In the third test, I was given another set of questions which in essence had a similar concept to the first test provided by 16personalities. My results from the first and second tests were further solidified through this personality test as it also stated similar percentages regarding my social and analysis skills, while also contributing a percentage on my imaginative aspect of my mind. </p>
					<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
						<p>These results have made me realise the pros and cons of my personality in a group setting. I find my self often fighting for my ideas to be implemented in thd final product and this is due to my debating nature. However this is taken over by my ability to communicate confidently to my teammates as I would say that I am able to politely able to present my ideas to the rest of the groups and through my version of persuasion, sometimes change the minds of the other individuals in the group to agree with my ideas, it can be seen as a positive however to many this is a negative as it clashes with their personality, one which does not tolerate individuals who are stubborn, much like myself.</p>
					<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
						<p>When I am given the opportunity to form a team or group, I will first attempt to suppress my desires to take control of the group and instead keep an open-mind when approaching the group and listening to differing concepts presented by the other members of the group. As someone who knows that it is almost impossible to always be in a group that completely agrees with you ideas it is essential that I must learn to comprehend the different personalities that many other people possess and conform to their way of communicating. If given the chance I would choose people that match the same energy that I exert in order to make the process of cooperation much more streamline.</p>
